<p> I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="https://computing.smu.edu.sg/">School of Computing and Information Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/">Singapore Management University (SMU)</a>. Before joining SMU, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher working with <a href="https://dimadamen.github.io/"> Prof. Dima Damen </a> at the University of Bristol, contributing to the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/projects/visualai/">EPSRC Visual AI Program Grant</a> led by <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/">Prof. Andrew Zisserman </a>. I earned my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk">City University of Hong Kong</a> in 2021, under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/ngo-chong-wah-601">Prof. Chong-Wah Ngo</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/">Dr. Wing-Kwong Chan</a>. Earlier, I obtained my master and bachelor degrees from <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> and <a href="http://www.seu.edu.cn/">Southeast University</a> respectively. </p>


<p>My research interest lies in Human Centered Multimedia Computing, including Cross-modal retrieval, Multi‐modal Large Language Model, Egocentric Video Understanding, Generative models and AI for Healthcare. Specifically, the objective is to conduct frontier research and develop cutting-edge technologies for processing, modeling, analyzing, understanding and generating multimedia content, that facilitate natural and immersive human experience and exert positive impact for our society. </p>

<p>🔥🔥🔥<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">Openings:</span> I am actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students, CSC visiting students, and (remote) interns. In addition, I am looking for postdoctoral researchers and funded visiting students to work on embodied AI. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email with your CV and other supporting documents (if any). </p>
