<p> I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="https://computing.smu.edu.sg/">School of Computing and Information Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/">Singapore Management University (SMU)</a>. Before joining SMU, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher working with <a href="https://dimadamen.github.io/"> Prof. Dima Damen </a> at the University of Bristol, contributing to the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/projects/visualai/">EPSRC Visual AI Program Grant</a> led by <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/">Prof. Andrew Zisserman </a>. I earned my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk">City University of Hong Kong</a> in 2021, under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/ngo-chong-wah-601">Prof. Chong-Wah Ngo</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/">Dr. Wing-Kwong Chan</a>. Earlier, I obtained my master and bachelor degrees from <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> and <a href="http://www.seu.edu.cn/">Southeast University</a> respectively. </p>


<p>My research interest lies in Human Centered Multimedia Computing, including Cross-modal retrieval, Multi‚Äêmodal Large Language Model, Egocentric Video Understanding, Generative models and AI for Healthcare. Specifically, the objective is to conduct frontier research and develop cutting-edge technologies for processing, modeling, analyzing, understanding and generating multimedia content, that facilitate natural and immersive human experience and exert positive impact for our society. </p>
